# About

I've been researching DeFi ecosystem for several weeks, and can't find a good list of actually working products without gimmick and bullshit. That's why I decided to make this site with the best DeFI products.

## Are you ready for prime time?
* Working product on mainnet (Not coming soon, Not on testnet)
* Visible traction (Not empty marketplace)
* No tribalism and bias (Ethereum, Tron, EOS)
* Are you feel comfortable to recommend this product to your IRL friends?
* Region is not supported it's a spit in the face of DeFi.
