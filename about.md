# What is this?

DeFi is the movement that leverages decentralized networks to transform old [financial products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system) into trustless and transparent protocols that run without intermediaries.

I've been researching DeFi ecosystem for several weeks, and can't find a good list of actually working products without gimmicks and bullshit. That's why I decided to create this site featuring best DeFI products.

## Definition of 'the best DeFi Products'
* Are you feel comfortable to recommend this product to your IRL friends?
* Working product on the mainnet (Not coming soon, Not testnet)
* Visible product traction (Not empty marketplace, Not empty order book)
* Decentralized first. Label 'Region is not supported' it's a spit in the face of DeFi.
* No crypto tribalism and bias. Ethereum, Tron, EOS, Bitcoin and all others are equal as long as DeFi product built on top is useful.
