Daniel Wang talks about Loopring Protocol and the future of decentralized exchanges.

## Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?

I am Daniel Wang, the creator of the [Loopring Protocol](https://loopring.org/), founder, and chairman of the Loopring Foundation. I used to work for Google. In 2014, I founded a startup that offered a centralized exchange service to help people buy and sell BTC/LTC/XRP/etc. The business wasn’t successful, so I closed it. I later joined an insurance company and built a similar product, still focusing on digital asset trading.

Loopring is a decentralized, [open-source](https://github.com/loopring) protocol that uses innovative technology to solve the biggest problems of modern centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. It enhances existing technology with an automated order ring-mining system. This shields users from counterparty risks and increases the security, liquidity, and transparency of all transactions.

Loopring also serves as a decentralized exchange protocol across crypto tokens, creating an unparalleled level of convenience in the rising cryptocurrency market. Tokens remain in a user’s control throughout the trading process, unlike other services that placing tokens in a centralized exchange wallet.

## What's Loopring backstory?

The idea of Loopring came up to me while at my previous employer. I was obsessed with it, so I quit and did an ICO for Loopring. The ICO was very successful, but we ended up refunding most of the ether raised (close to 100K) to participants due to [regulations in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41157249). We decided to continue development with we had left, though. The Loopring protocol adapts the idea of “managing, sharing, and matching orders off the chain and settling trade on the chain.” The on-chain part is the protocol, and the off-chain part is the relayer, which is very similar to the 0x protocol.

## What went into building the Loopring?

Loopring is an open protocol for building decentralized exchanges. Loopring operates as a public set of smart contracts responsible for trading and settlement, with an off-chain group of actors aggregating and communicating orders. The protocol is free, extensible, and serves as a standardized building block for decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchange functionality. Its interoperable standards facilitate trustless, anonymous trading.

A significant advantage over current decentralized exchange protocols is the ability for orders to be mix-and-matched with other, dissimilar orders, obviating the constraints of two-token trading pairs and drastically improving liquidity. Loopring also employs a unique and robust solution to prevent front-running, the unfair attempt to submit transactions into a block quicker than the original solution provider. Loopring is a blockchain agnostic and is deployable on any blockchain with smart contract functionality.

The three primary risks of centralized exchanges are:
1. Lack of security,
2. Lack of transparency,  
3. Lack of liquidity.

Decentralized exchanges differ from centralized exchanges in part because users maintain control of their private-keys (assets) by performing trades directly on the underlying blockchain. By leveraging the trustless technology of cryptocurrencies themselves, they successfully mitigate many of the aforementioned risks surrounding exchange. Loopring is not a DEX, but a modular protocol for building DEXs on multiple blockchains. We disassemble the parts of a traditional exchange and offer a set of public smart contracts and decentralized actors in its place.

Loopring Foundation is a blockchain research organization focused on decentralized trading protocols. The open-source Loopring Protocol provides a fundamental building block for non-custodial exchanges (DEXs) and other applications that incorporate trustless token trading. [Loopring 3.0](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-protocol-3-0-design-doc-17eae15d137b) leverages zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for significant throughput increases while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum blockchain. Loopring also offers an auction protocol called [Oedax](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/oedax-looprings-open-ended-dutch-auction-exchange-model-d92cebbd3667) (Open-Ended Dutch Auction Exchange). We will launch our mainnet at the end of August, 2019.

## What's your business model?

Loopring concluded a successful ICO in August 2017, raising $45 million USD over a two-week period. The Loopring project is supported by 13 full-time staff members, which includes nine engineers.

Loopring is working in a unique space in the blockchain sector with the development of a decentralized exchange protocol but is similar in composition to the [0x project](https://0x.org). Both projects use an open smart contract system to facilitate trades.

On the surface, it seems as if 0x is the same as Loopring, but there is a key difference between the two. Since 0x allows anyone to run a node as a decentralized exchange, and all orders are processed off-chain but settled on-chain, 0x only gets its liquidity from exchanges established on the 0x platform. This is a huge difference from Loopring, where liquidity comes from any exchange that connects to the Loopring Network.

There are some other competitors such as [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/), [Blocknet](https://blocknet.co/), and [Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/). Kyber Network and Bancor have liquidity pools and order matching that ensures trades are met across smart contracts, and Blocknet works in a similar fashion but solely with order matching. There is not a competitor that offers ring orders identical to the ring matching done by the Loopring protocol.

## What’s your position on the regulatory landscape today?

Blockchain technologies have the potential to improve the transparency, efficiency, and reliability of transactions in the heavily regulated pharmaceutical industry. The world is slowly beginning to understand that blockchain has the potential to benefit many different industries. Some authorities are cautious about emerging technology and are reluctant to adopt supportive laws. Others recognize the advantages of blockchain and continue to issue favorable legislation. Still, there are numerous legal challenges that need to be resolved before we can further the expansion of blockchain technology.

## What are your goals for the future?

With our full design released to the world, we look forward to receiving feedback from some of the brightest minds in Ethereum, other blockchains, zero knowledge cryptographers, traders, and of course, DEX owners or would-be owners. The code base is actually pretty much complete as well; we will open source it next week. Within the next month or two, we will have a testnet implementation. In six months, we hope to have a mainnet application deployed. Our aim is to see DEXs built atop Loopring Protocol 3.0 handle more than 1,000 trades per second by the end of 2019.


## What are your future thoughts for the DeFi market?

The initial group of projects within #DeFi are mostly [based on Ethereum](/ethereum). But this doesn’t mean that a decentralized finance ecosystem can’t flourish across all blockchains. In any case, decentralized finance removes the need for external validation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. #DeFi doesn’t require banks and financial institutions to incorporate the technology.

Rather, it shows that the crypto world is flourishing on its own, without the need for external validation or regulation. #DeFi is creating new channels for adopting crypto. It’s encouraging a new wave of financial entrepreneurship which would be stifled in the world of traditional banking. Furthermore, #DeFi is based on peers exchanging digital currency online. Aside from the obvious need to onboard crypto from fiat, it doesn’t require the intermediation of a financial institution.
