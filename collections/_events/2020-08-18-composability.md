product-description: "DeFi's killer feature is arguably composability. The ability to design new products by pulling together a technology and product stack from a range of tested and market-ready solutions opens a plethora of possibilities for financial product innovation. Along with new innovation opportunities comes increased complexity along the entire value chain from the design of each instrument to the foundational data layer."
