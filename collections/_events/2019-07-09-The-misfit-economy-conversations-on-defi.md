product-description: Around the world, marginalized industries and populations are prevented from participating in the formal financial system. So what types of financial innovation are needed to address these concrete, real-world problems? Is technology the primary factor restricting access to financial services for a Somalian entrepreneur, or Cannabis company, or is it identity, an oppressive regime, or something else? Just as the internet allowed for the creation of a new information infrastructure, blockchain technology allows for the creation of a new financial infrastructure. The DeFi movement has emerged in an attempt to make the infrastructure that supports new and existing blockchain-based markets just as decentralized as the underlying technology, increasing transparency, decreasing costs, and reducing the opportunity for censorship and / or manipulation.
