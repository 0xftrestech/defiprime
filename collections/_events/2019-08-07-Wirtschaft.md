product-description: 'DeFi has been one of the hottest topics in the blockchain world for the past year, but it left us with a myriad of unanswered questions:

What are the key challenges hindering wide-spread adoption of DeFi and how should we overcome them? What do continent-specific outlooks on DeFi look like and how do they differ? And what is DeFi anyway?

We will be discussing this and more with industry leaders and renowned venture capitalists from all around the globe.'
