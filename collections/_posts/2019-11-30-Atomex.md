Atomex

### Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?

My name is Igor Matsak, co-founder of [Atomex](https://atomex.me/). We are working on Atomex as a part of our diverse team. Many of us and me as well were studying together at university having cryptography and maths as our majors. Then some of us got vast experience in investments and others were working in software engineering. Fortunately about four years ago we were united by inspiration of blockchains, which were very fitting to our background. Crypto still needs another tone of cozy and reliable things to become adopted, so we are excited to bring our part.

Atomex is our hybrid DEX based on atomic swap technology and a multicurrency HD wallet. It allows storing funds locally and keeping them liquid at the same time. So, users can make an exchange of their funds to another cryptocurrency just like they do an ordinary blockchain transaction. And it is done in a trustless decentralized manner, without sending crypto to any third party.

### What's Atomex backstory?

Our quite a big independent team has a wide range of interests. (Except for quantitative trading and other industries startups) we are also quite known in Tezos community as Baking Bad. In the last year we released the [baking-bad.org](https://baking-bad.org) explorer for bakers and delegators in Tezos, the [better-call.dev](https://better-call.dev/) smart-contracts explorer and Python (Pytezos) and C# (Netezos) wraps for Tezos nodes.

We loved atomic swaps because they expand the list of things people can do on-chain. I think the main point is similar to the whole cryptocurrency idea. So, it’s all about decentralization. Like Bitcoin is a way a payment system could be built in a decentralized style, atomic swaps is a way a crypto exchange could be built decentralized. Swaps just use the same cryptographic principles to eliminate gaps between blockchains.

We started from a scratch. The atomic swap technic seems to be quite simple and powerful, but there are still very few popular implementations. Why? As we turned out it is pretty tricky to make a user-friendly app on its base. Assuming market volatility, different chain’s specifics, changing fees etc. it is quite challenging to provide a 24 hour exchange option.

That exiting process takes all our experience to cover all the parts from head to toe, starting from cryptography basics and ending with trading principles.

The main thing that’s inspiring us on the way is that Atomex can help cryptocurrencies to make another step further to stay a full-fledged and independent ecosystem that operates differently.

### What went into building the Atomex?

It took about 1.5 years to make the first release on mainnet. And now we still have a more like an MVP with 4 currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Tezos, but it is fully working. So we've been watching from the inside how the industry is developing. Comparing blockchains we noticed that the newest blockchains are changing faster. So Tezos is now the most changing environment we work with. Also, the DEX sector is developing really fast today including all possible sorts of on-chain exchanging with varying degrees of trust and decentralization.

As for us we decided to build a fully trustless service. Perhaps, there must be place for liquidity to meet. Our solution was to make a hybrid model with two basic points:
-        all the on-chain exchange work is done independently on the client side;
-        liquidity is collected and matched on the Atomex server.

So after the deal sides have met each other on the server, their apps operate with blockchains on their own to execute the operation. That model gives both the efficiency for bringing enough liquidity to the market and the trustless and independent on-chain exchanging process. As I have mentioned the exchange is done through the atomic swap scheme. This technique is based on the locking transactions that are explained in our welcome [article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/atomex-cross-chain-atomic-swaps-on-practice-8139571f0ee5).

Being trustless also requires Atomex app to open source. It helps to get more people involved in testing the app ensuring that the code is reliable and has no security issues. On our way, we tried to use as much existing open-source code as possible but also rewrote some RPC libraries and nodes wrappings, and eliminated some bugs in existing cryptography libs. The exciting thing is that in the first month after mainnet release we've already got in touch with a number of great projects including defi projects such as [DEX.ag](http://dex.ag) and [bZx Protocol](http://bzx.network). So we feel an increasing potential in that field.

One of the most thought-provoking parts on the way is that decentralized apps commonly offer a bit unusual user experience. It's also Atomex business. As all the blockchain work is done by the client app, it requires to keep the app online throughout the process. That’s a hard one for the UI.

Another thing is that Atomex doesn’t serve high speculative trading style, as every exchange operation takes at least 5 minutes to be mined in both blockchains. However, it is always faster than an ordinary full circle operation for users that don’t store their funds on centralized exchanges because the deposit and withdrawal times have to be taken into account.

### What's your business model?

Atomex has no additional fees, so users pay only miner’s commissions for transactions.
Now we charge market-makers that provide the Atomex exchange with liquidity and can make profits from market-making strategies. For now, we have a very limited group of market-makers, who are very dedicated to the service’s success. But we are going straight to make limit orders and market-making option available on every client app.

We consider our target auditory to be crypto enthusiasts, those who believe in ideas behind the blockchain technology and who is paranoid in a good sense. So our priority for today is to offer the most useful and competitive service as possible.

Eventually, regulatory limitations could play a key role in a significant shift to decentralized blockchain tools. Due to that, we are considering Atomex architecture to be easy to scale for general market use.

Today are a lot of other projects in our scope, maybe the AtomicDEX from Komodo is the most recognizable of them. Atomex is supposed to be a quality implementation of the nice atomic swaps technology which distinctive feature is usability. We are not concerned about similar competitors, actually, we are tuned to the most possible cooperation with other defi’s as possible. I think it’s the best strategy to compete with centralized entities in the industry.

### What’s your position on the regulatory landscape today?

Regulation cuts some blockchain technology value today. We believe DEXs could help blockchains to keep moving in the technologies-vs-regulation tag play. In that sense, centralized exchanges seem to be a kind of temporary solution.

As Atomex has decentralized execution architecture, it doesn’t require any KYC for users. And making limit orders available for every client would completely eliminate regulatory issues in the future.

### What are your goals for the future?

Atomex great goal is definitely to become a useful tool for future decentralized economy.

To achieve this Atomex roadmap now includes these big roadblocks:
-  adding more chains;
-  adding different chains and standards tokens support;
-  adding REST API for external wallets integration;
-  adding hardware wallets support;
-  adding more nice features like different staking options.

### What are your future thoughts for the DeFi market?

In the next few years, we are likely to witness the emergence of numerous digitized assets. There will be fiat currencies, real estate, precious metals, and other asset classes. With current tech, we will be able to do things like trustless deals, collateralized loans, margin trading, derivatives, structured products, autonomous organizations, and more, and all this on-chain.
